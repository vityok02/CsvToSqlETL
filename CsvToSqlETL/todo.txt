1. Import from csv to ms sql.
  Store the following columns:
  - tpep_pickup_datetime
  - tpep_dropoff_datetime
  - passenger_count
  - trip_distance
  - store_and_fwd_flag
  - PULocationID
  - DOLocationID
  - fare_amount
  - tip_amount

2. Set up Sql server.

3. Design the database schema.

4. Provide scheme for following queries:
  - Find out which PULocationId (Pick-up location ID) has the highest tip_amount on average.
  - Find the top 100 longest fares in terms of trip_distance.
  - Find the top 100 longest fares in terms of time spent traveling.
  - Search, where part of the conditions is PULocationId.

5. Implement efficient bulk insertion of the processed records into the database.

6. Implement efficient bulk insertion of the processed records into the database.
  Identify and remove any duplicate records from the dataset based on a combination of 
  'pickup_datetime', 'dropoff_datetime', and 'passenger_count'. 
  Write all removed duplicates into a duplicates.csv file.

7. For the 'store_and_fwd_flag' column, convert any 'N' values to 'No' and any 'Y' values to 'Yes'.

8. Ensure that all text-based fields are free from leading or trailing whitespace.

9. Assume your program will be used on much larger data files. 
  Describe in a few sentences what you would change if you knew it would be used for a 10GB CSV input file.

10. The input data is in the EST timezone. Convert it to UTC when inserting into the DB.
